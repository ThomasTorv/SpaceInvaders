# Space Invaders

A compact Space Invaders clone built with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). Pilot a laser cannon, clear waves of invaders, and push your score as high as you can.

## Features

- Responsive keyboard controls (arrow keys / A & D, space to fire)
- Increasingly challenging waves that accelerate as they descend
- Score, lives, and level HUD with a post-game summary screen
- Minimal dependencies—just Python 3.9+ and pygame

2. Install the dependency:

   ```

3. Launch the game:
